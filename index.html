      <section>
        <h4>Before you start there a couple of tools i recommend you make sure to
          have on hand, those are:
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>A wire cutter</li>
          <li>A string winder</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Removing the old strings</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Grab your string winder and begin to unwind the strings one by one
            until each string is free of any tension
          </li>
          <li>Cut each string around the 12th fret and remove them from the
            tuning pegs and bridge
          </li>
          <li>Collect all the strings and then tie a simple
            loop knot with them for easy disposal and to prevent you loosing
            any of them
          </li>
          <li>If your guitar needs any cleaning or conditioning on the fretboard
            now is a good time to do that since you will have easy access to it
          </li>

        <h2>Putting new strings on <i>modern style</i> tuners</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Start by inserting all six strings through the bridge first</li>
          <li>Starting with the low e string, pull it trough the tuning peg hole
            and measure two tuning pegs up from the one you are inserting
            the string and cut it there(this will ensure you have enough slack to
            get enough winds on the peg). For each successive string measure
            half a tuning peg more, so the A string will be 2.5 pegs up, the D
            string will be 3 pegs up and so on. This should result in around there
            wraps around the peg which is a good amount.
          </li>
          <li>Pull the string back and leave about 1cm sticking trough
            the hole, give the string a little kink and start winding, make sure
            to keep some pressure on the string to prevent it from slipping.
            Don't wind up to pitch just yet, keep the strings somewhat loose still
            but with enough tension so that the string wont slip if you let go of it.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat until all strings are in place</li>
          <li>Before you start tuning to pitch I recommend that you
            give each string a little stretch, you can do so by pressing the string
            down a few times passed the nut, also stretch them at the bridge by
            holding the string individually at the 12th fret and pulling upwards
            gently.
          </li>
          <li>Now tune up to desired pitch and you're good!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might find that the strings will slip out of tune as you
          start playing them, this is normal and what we call the "break in period".

        <h2>Putting new strings on <i>vintage style</i> tuners</h2>
        <p>Restringing a guitar with <i>vintage style</i> tuning pegs is very similar,
          only I would cut the string just a bit longer than i do for <i>modern style pegs.</i>
          This is to account for the length the string needs to be fed into the
          hole of the peg. The technique is also a bit different, i will go
          over it below.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start by inserting all six strings through the bridge first</li>
          <li>Starting with the low e string, pull it beyond the tuning peg
            and measure about two and a half tuning pegs up from the one you are inserting
            the string and cut it there. For each successive string measure
            half a tuning peg more, so the A string will be three pegs up, the D
            string will be three and a half pegs up and so on. This should result in around there
            wraps around the peg which is a good amount.
          </li>
          <li>A good tip is to make sure all tuners are aligned with the neck before
            you start, by that I mean having the straight cutouts face the same direction
            as the neck.
          </li>
          <li>Take the string and feed it down the hole and give it a 90 degree
            wrap clockwise around the "half moon", keep pressure on the string
            and start winding. Don't wind up to pitch just yet, keep the strings somewhat loose still
            but with enough tension so that the string wont slip if you let go of it.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat until all strings are in place

          </li>
          <li>Before you start tuning to pitch I recommend that you
            give each string a little stretch, you can do so by pressing the string
            down a few times passed the nut, also stretch them at the bridge by
